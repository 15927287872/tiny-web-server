A tiny web server in c
======================

I am reading
[Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/).
It teachers me how to write a tiny web server in C. 

I have written another
[tiny web server](https://github.com/shenfeng/nio-httpserver) in JAVA.

### Usage
like python -m SimpleHTTPServer, for daily use,  but should be faster.

### TODO
1. Implement directory listing
2. Implement byte-range for in browser MP4 playing
3. define MIME mapping
4. write a epoll version for performance comparison with my JAVA version
